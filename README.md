# Data_Analysis_Projects
# About
Hi, I am Karthi. I have an Educational Background in Bachelor of Engineering. I am on Track to develop my Strong foundation in the data analysis field. Started my career in python developing I transitioned into Data Analysis and been working in this field for past one year. I honed my ability to develop and execute python codes, SQL and work in Excel, Statistics to optimize the operations and generate impactful results.

# Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology I used to solve cases.
# Data Fusion and Analysis Pipeline using Python
**Description:**
I Developed and implemented a sophisticated data processing pipeline in Python to automate various data manipulation tasks. This pipeline was designed to handle multiple CSV files, streamlining the data preparation process to ensure data integrity and enhance analytical capabilities. Key aspects of the project include:

Automated Data Cleaning:
Missing Value Imputation: Developed algorithms to automatically detect and impute missing values using appropriate statistical methods, ensuring the completeness of the dataset.
Data Merging: Efficiently combined data from multiple CSV files into a unified dataset, managing different schemas and formats seamlessly.
Data Enhancement for Clarity:
Splitting Employee Names: Implemented functionality to split full names into first and last names, improving data clarity and consistency.
Joining Datasets: Integrated multiple datasets by joining them on key attributes, facilitating comprehensive analysis across different data sources.
Data Quality Checks: Established rigorous data quality checks to validate data accuracy and consistency, identifying and correcting anomalies in the dataset.
Advanced Data Transformations:
Bonus Computation: Calculated employee bonuses based on predefined criteria and integrated these calculations into the dataset for further analysis.
Designation Adjustments: Automated the updating of employee designations based on predefined rules, ensuring up-to-date and accurate job title information.
Aggregations for Insights: Performed complex data aggregations to derive meaningful insights, supporting decision-making processes with accurate and detailed data analysis.
By automating these tasks, the pipeline significantly reduced manual effort, minimized errors, and provided a robust foundation for insightful analysis and data-driven decision making. This project demonstrated my ability to leverage Python for complex data processing tasks, enhancing data quality and enabling more informed business decisions.

**Skills:**
Data Analysis, Data Manipulation, Data Processing, Word Document, Report Generation

# MS-Excel
**Description:**
As a Growth and Strategy Analyst for an e-commerce company, I conducted a comprehensive funnel analysis to generate performance insights for the year 2019. The analysis was based on the 'Funnel Case Study Data' workbook, which included session details, channel-wise traffic, and supporting data.
**Key Tasks and Insights:**

Order Trends Analysis:
Identified increase or decrease in the number of orders using the Session Details sheet.
Recognized dates with significant order hikes or drops compared to the same day the previous week.

Traffic Analysis:
Analyzed changes in traffic (listing sessions) compared to the same day the previous week using the Channel-wise Traffic sheet.
Determined sources of traffic fluctuations.

Conversion Rate Analysis:
Evaluated overall conversion rates and identified fluctuations.
Broke down the conversion process into smaller metrics: Listing to Menu (L2M), Menu to Cart (M2C), Cart to Payment (C2P), and Payment to Order (P2O).
Pinpointed specific stages in the conversion funnel that were fluctuating.

Hypothesis and Validation:
Developed hypotheses for observed fluctuations in conversions.
Validated hypotheses using supporting data, including average discounts, packaging charges, delivery charges, and more.

Report and Documentation:
Compiled a detailed report summarizing all insights and identifying dates with significant order changes.
Explained reasons for order fluctuations based on traffic and conversion analysis.
Provided structured and formatted documentation with charts, tables, and conditional formatting to support findings.

Tools and Techniques:
Data Analysis and Visualization (Excel)
Funnel Conversion Metrics
Comparative Analysis (Week-over-Week)
Hypothesis Testing and Validation

**Results and Impact:**
The project provided actionable insights into order trends, traffic sources, and conversion rates. It helped identify key areas for strategic improvement and informed data-driven decision-making to enhance platform performance.


# SQL

**Description:**
worked on a comprehensive data analysis project using SQL to explore and analyze the AirlineDB, a database containing flight-related data including transactions, tickets, flight schedules, airports, and aircraft information. The project involved extracting actionable insights and solving real-world business problems for an airline. Key analyses included:

Seat Allocation: Identified the least allocated seat number across all flights.
Passenger Revenue: Analyzed month-wise highest and lowest paying passengers, including passenger names and IDs.
Journey Analysis: Discovered travel details for non-stop and return journeys.
Boarding Pass Issues: Flagged tickets without boarding passes for further investigation.
Flight Analysis: Found the longest flight and explored its details.
Geographic Insights: Listed airports based on specific time zones and identified airports with the maximum number of departures.
Flight Performance: Analyzed specific brands of flights that experienced cancellations or delays.
Cancellation Insights: Identified the airport with the highest number of canceled flights and passengers who received refunds due to cancellations.
Aircraft Range: Investigated the details of the flight with the highest range.
This project showcased my ability to work with complex relational databases, design and optimize queries, and deliver data-driven insights for operational improvements in the airline industry.
