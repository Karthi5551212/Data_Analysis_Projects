# About
Hi, I am Karthi. I have an Educational Background in Bachelor of Engineering. I am on Track to develop my Strong foundation in the data analysis field. Started my career in python developing I transitioned into Data Analysis and been working in this field for past one year. I honed my ability to develop and execute python codes, SQL and work in Excel, Statistics to optimize the operations and generate impactful results.

# Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology I used to solve cases.
# Data Fusion and Analysis Pipeline using Python
Description:
I Developed and implemented a sophisticated data processing pipeline in Python to automate various data manipulation tasks. This pipeline was designed to handle multiple CSV files, streamlining the data preparation process to ensure data integrity and enhance analytical capabilities. Key aspects of the project include:

Automated Data Cleaning:
Missing Value Imputation: Developed algorithms to automatically detect and impute missing values using appropriate statistical methods, ensuring the completeness of the dataset.
Data Merging: Efficiently combined data from multiple CSV files into a unified dataset, managing different schemas and formats seamlessly.
Data Enhancement for Clarity:
Splitting Employee Names: Implemented functionality to split full names into first and last names, improving data clarity and consistency.
Joining Datasets: Integrated multiple datasets by joining them on key attributes, facilitating comprehensive analysis across different data sources.
Data Quality Checks: Established rigorous data quality checks to validate data accuracy and consistency, identifying and correcting anomalies in the dataset.
Advanced Data Transformations:
Bonus Computation: Calculated employee bonuses based on predefined criteria and integrated these calculations into the dataset for further analysis.
Designation Adjustments: Automated the updating of employee designations based on predefined rules, ensuring up-to-date and accurate job title information.
Aggregations for Insights: Performed complex data aggregations to derive meaningful insights, supporting decision-making processes with accurate and detailed data analysis.
By automating these tasks, the pipeline significantly reduced manual effort, minimized errors, and provided a robust foundation for insightful analysis and data-driven decision making. This project demonstrated my ability to leverage Python for complex data processing tasks, enhancing data quality and enabling more informed business decisions.
SKills:
